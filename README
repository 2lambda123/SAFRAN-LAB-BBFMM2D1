**********************
DIRECTORIES AND FILES:
**********************

./src/			:	Relevant C++ source code, i.e., the input files in C++
./exec/			:	Executables for BBFMM2D
./header/		:	Relevant header files
./README		:	This file
./License		:	License file
./Makefile		:	Makefile

******************
SETTING THINGS UP:
******************

1) To run this package, you need to have Eigen.

2) Download Eigen from here: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

3) Create a directory named Codes/ inside the main Eigen folder and copy the directory BBFMM2D/ into the directory Codes/.

4) Open the Makefile, which is inside the folder BBFMM2D. Ensure that you have included the path to Eigen in the line containing "CFLAGS". For instance, in the above setting, the path "-I ./../../" should be included in the Makefile.

4) Once you have this set up, you should be able to run the code. Check whether the code runs by performing the following action. Go to the directory where Makefile is in, then key in the following three commands in the terminal:

		make get_matrix_through_routine_standard_kernel
		cd release/
		./H2_2D_MVP_get_matrix_through_routine_standard_kernel

The code should now run.

	
********************
CHANGING THE INPUTS:
********************

The files you have control over are the files inside the directory ./src/, read through the files both must be self explanatory for the most part.

1) If you want to generate matrix through your own routine, and use the standard kernels:

Go to /src/, open "H2_2D_MVP_get_matrix_through_routine_standard_kernel.cpp".
--To generate matrix through routine: 
  Change void get_Location(unsigned long& N, VectorXd* location) and void get_charges(const unsigned long N, unsigned& m, MatrixXd& Htranspose)
--To use standard kernels: 
  Select the kernel type in main().
  Options of kernels:
  	LOGARITHM:          kernel_Logarithm
  	ONEOVERR2:          kernel_OneOverR2
  	GAUSSIAN:           kernel_Gaussian
  	QUADRIC:            kernel_Quadric
     	INVERSEQUADRIC:     kernel_InverseQuadric
     	THINPLATESPLINE:    kernel_ThinPlateSpline

	
2) If you want to read matrix from file, and use standard kernels:

Go to the folder /input/, put your input file inside of this folder.
Go to the folder /src/, open "H2_2D_MVP_input_from_file_standard_kernel.cpp".
--To change input filename:
  read_Location_and_Measurement_operator ("../input/test_input.txt", N, location, m, Htranspose).
--To use standard kernels:
  The same step as described in 1).


3) If you want to generate matrix through your own routine, and use your own kernel:

Go to /src/, open "H2_2D_MVP_get_matrix_through_routine_mykernel.cpp".
--To define your own kernel:
  Modify class mykernel. 
--To generate your matrix:
  The same step as described in 1).

4) If you want to read matrix from file, and use your own kernel:

Go to /src/, open "H2_2D_MVP_input_from_file_mykernel.cpp".
--To define your own kernel:
  Modify class mykernel. 
--To change input filename:
  The same step as described in 2).



***********
INPUT FILES
***********
Go to /input/, you should put your own input file in the input folder.

The file format is described as follows:

The first row should be like this:
Number of charges, Number of sets of charges

For example:

 5000, 10

For the rest of the rows, it should start with locations, followed by a row in Htranspose matrix(elements should be separated using ',') If some element is 0, you can leave it as empty instead of 0. If all the elements in a row is 0, nothing need to be typed after the location.(spaces are allowed)

The row should look like this:
(location[0],location[1]) (elem1,elem2,elem3,elem4,â€¦,elemn)

For example:

(-0.999984,-0.676221) (0.480685,0.869803,-0.188232,0.548587,-0.771039,0.73709,0.126494)
(0.869386,-0.5408)
(0.0655345,0.891162) (-0.193033,,-0.0287383,,-0.520512,0.33891,)
(0.342299,-0.246828) (0.0732668,,,,,,0.0951028)
(-0.984604,-0.44417) (,0.782447,-0.867924,0.485731,-0.729282,-0.481031,0.541473)


*****************
RUNNING THE CODE:
*****************
Here we give an example:
If you want to use "H2_2D_MVP_input_from_file_standard_kernel.cpp"

1) As stated earlier to run the code, go to the appropriate directory and key in the following:

		make input_from_file_standard_kernel

2) Make sure you have changed or cleaned the .o files from previous compilation. To clean the irrelevant files, key in:

		make clean

3) To tar the file, key in

		make tar

4) Read through the makefile for other options.

To run other .cpp files:

a) H2_2D_MVP_get_matrix_through_routine_mykernel.cpp
   key in:
   make get_matrix_through_routine_mykernel
b) H2_2D_MVP_get_matrix_through_routine_standard_kernel.cpp
   key in:
   make get_matrix_through_routine_standard_kernel
c) H2_2D_MVP_input_from_file_mykernel.cpp
   key in:
   make input_from_file_mykernel
