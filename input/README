INPUT FILES
===========

The first row be like this:
Number of unknowns, Number of measurements

For example:

 5000, 10

For the rest of the rows, it should start with locations, followed by a row in Htranspose matrix(elements should be separated using ',') If some element is 0, you should leave it as empty instead of 0. If all the elements in a row is 0, nothing need to be typed after the location.(spaces are allowed)

The row should look like this:
(location[0],location[1]) (elem1,elem2,elem3,elem4,â€¦,elemn)

For example:

 (-0.999984,-0.676221) (0.480685,0.869803,-0.188232,0.548587,-0.771039,0.73709,0.126494,0.192156,0.843071,-0.741247)
 (0.869386,-0.5408)
 (0.0655345,0.891162) (-0.193033,,-0.0287383,,-0.520512,0.33891,0.0773396,0.630567,0.730129,)
 (0.342299,-0.246828) (0.0732668,,,,,,,0.0951028,,0.0116719)
